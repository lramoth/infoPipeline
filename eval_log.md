## Open questions

- What are the exact stage attribute/method names and signatures for the name, executable work, and validation criteria?
- What is the exact validation-result type and shape containing pass/fail plus reason?
- What are the Planner's module/class/function name, constructor arguments, run entry point, and success result?
- How exactly is a validation failure or caught stage exception reported to the caller (returned result or raised exception, including its type/shape)?
- When stage execution raises before producing output, what value must be stored in the ledger's required `output` field?

## Build log

- 2026-06-19: Read `AGENTS.md`, `architecture.md`, and the latest `specs/planner_feature.md`. The spec defines treatment of errors during stage execution or validation, but still provides only behavioral descriptions rather than the public Python contract required for implementation and tests. No implementation or tests were added because choosing names, signatures, result types, failure reporting, or the missing-output ledger value would be guessing. Spec used: `specs/planner_feature.md`. Assumptions: none. Gaps: public stage/Planner interfaces and execution-error output representation remain unspecified.

## Build log

- 2026-06-19: Implemented the pure-stdlib Planner in `planner.py` from `specs/planner_feature.md`, including ordered run/validation, per-stage ledger persistence, daily reset/reuse behavior, overwrite-on-rerun, clean halting, caller-visible results, and run/validation exception handling. Added six focused `unittest` tests in `test_planner.py`; all pass. Following the updated `AGENTS.md` instruction for unspecified implementation details, selected `Stage(name, run, validate)`, validation results shaped as `(bool, reason)`, `Planner.run()` returning `RunResult`, UTC ISO 8601 timestamps, and `null` output when execution fails before producing a value. Gaps or suspected bugs: none.
